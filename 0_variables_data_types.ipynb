    "## What is a variable?\n",
    "A variable is a named space in the computer's memory that can hold a piece of data. (This is a bit of a simplification, but for now this is all we need.)\n",

    "When we create a variable - meaning we tell the computer to reserve a bit of memory and give it a name - we say we are **declaring** the variable. \n",

    "When we put a value in our variable - we say we are **assinging** the value to the variable.\n",
